# Modelling ideas
* [ ] Persistance models (General, moving average/max/min)
    * [ ] Pre-defined horizon/window
    * [ ] Dynamic horizon/window
* [ ] ARMA/ARIMA
* [ ] ANNs
    * [ ] LSTMs
        * [ ] Combine with Convolution layer on outputs?
    * [ ] CNNs
    * [ ] Autoencoder? May be good to enforce consitency with other labels
* [ ] Simpler models
    * [ ] Linear regression
    * [ ] RandomForest/XGBoost
    * [ ] NN-based modelling
